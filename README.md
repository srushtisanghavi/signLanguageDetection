# Project Title: Sign Language Detection using LSTM Neural Network

This project is a practical implementation of sign language estimation using an LSTM Neural Network built on TF Keras.

This versatile tool can be integrated into communication apps, allowing regular users to understand and interpret sign language gestures recorded by the hearing impaired. 
Perfect for individuals not familiar with sign language, this model bridges the gap, making communication inclusive and accessible.

Currently trained on ASL actions like 'Hello', 'Thank you', 'Happy', and 'I Love You', with ongoing development aiming to encompass all ASL sign languages.
